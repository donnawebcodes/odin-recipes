          <h2>Steps</h2>
        </div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large saucepan, bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a separate large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
            Add the onion and garlic and sauté until the onion is soft and
            translucent, about 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the Arborio rice to the onion and garlic mixture and stir to
            coat the rice with the oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the white wine and cook, stirring constantly, until the wine is
            absorbed by the rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a ladleful of the hot broth to the rice and stir constantly
            until the broth is absorbed. Repeat this process, one ladleful at a
            time, stirring constantly and letting each ladleful of broth be
            absorbed before adding the next one. This process should take about
            20-25 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            While you are adding the broth to the rice, sauté the mushrooms in a
            separate pan until they are browned and cooked through. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once all the broth has been absorbed and the rice is tender, add the
            sautéed mushrooms, grated Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper to the
            risotto. Stir until everything is combined and heated through.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve the risotto immediately, garnished with chopped fresh parsley.
          </li>
